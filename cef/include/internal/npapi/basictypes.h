// The arraysize(arr) macro returns the # of elements in an array arr.

//
// One caveat is that arraysize() doesn't accept any array of an
// anonymous type or a type defined inside a function.  In these rare
// cases, you have to use the unsafe ARRAYSIZE_UNSAFE() macro below.  This is
// due to a limitation in C++'s template system.  The limitation might

// ARRAYSIZE_UNSAFE performs essentially the same calculation as arraysize,
// but can be used on anonymous types or types defined inside
// functions.  It's less safe than arraysize as it accepts some
// (although not all) pointers.  Therefore, you should use arraysize
// whenever possible.
//
// The expression ARRAYSIZE_UNSAFE(a) is a compile-time constant of type
// size_t.
//
// ARRAYSIZE_UNSAFE catches a few type errors.  If you see a compiler error
//
//   "warning: division by zero in ..."
//
// when using ARRAYSIZE_UNSAFE, you are (wrongfully) giving it a pointer.
// You should only use ARRAYSIZE_UNSAFE on statically allocated arrays.
//
// The following comments are on the implementation details, and can
// be ignored by the users.
//
// ARRAYSIZE_UNSAFE(arr) works by inspecting sizeof(arr) (the # of bytes in
// the array) and sizeof(*(arr)) (the # of bytes in one array
// element).  If the former is divisible by the latter, perhaps arr is
// indeed an array, in which case the division result is the # of
// elements in the array.  Otherwise, arr cannot possibly be an array,
// and we generate a compiler error to prevent the code from
// compiling.
//
// Since the size of bool is implementation-defined, we need to cast
// !(sizeof(a) & sizeof(*(a))) to size_t in order to ensure the final
// result has type size_t.
//
// This macro is not perfect as it wrongfully accepts certain
// pointers, namely where the pointer size is divisible by the pointee
// size.  Since all our code has to go through a 32-bit compiler,
// where a pointer is 4 bytes, this means all pointers to a type whose
// size is 3 or greater than 4 will be (righteously) rejected.

// Use implicit_cast as a safe version of static_cast or const_cast
// for upcasting in the type hierarchy (i.e. casting a pointer to Foo
// to a pointer to SuperclassOfFoo or casting a pointer to Foo to
// a const pointer to Foo).
// When you use implicit_cast, the compiler checks that the cast is safe.
// Such explicit implicit_casts are necessary in surprisingly many
// situations where C++ demands an exact type match instead of an
// argument type convertable to a target type.
//
// The From type can be inferred, so the preferred syntax for using
// implicit_cast is the same as for static_cast etc.:
//
//   implicit_cast<ToType>(expr)
//
// implicit_cast would have been part of the C++ standard library,
// but the proposal was submitted too late.  It will probably make
// its way into the language in the future.

// The COMPILE_ASSERT macro can be used to verify that a compile time

//
//   COMPILE_ASSERT(ARRAYSIZE_UNSAFE(content_type_names) == CONTENT_NUM_TYPES,
//                  content_type_names_incorrect_size);
//
// or to make sure a struct is smaller than a certain size:
//
//   COMPILE_ASSERT(sizeof(foo) < 128, foo_too_large);
//
// The second argument to the macro is the name of the variable. If
// the expression is false, most compilers will issue a warning/error
// containing the name of the variable.

// Implementation details of COMPILE_ASSERT:
//
// - COMPILE_ASSERT works by defining an array type that has -1
//   elements (and thus is invalid) when the expression is false.
//
// - The simpler definition
//
//     #define COMPILE_ASSERT(expr, msg) typedef char msg[(expr) ? 1 : -1]
//
//   does not work, as gcc supports variable-length arrays whose sizes
//   are determined at run-time (this is gcc's extension and not part
//   of the C++ standard).  As a result, gcc fails to reject the
//   following code with the simple definition:
//
//     int foo;
//     COMPILE_ASSERT(foo, msg); // not supposed to compile as foo is
//                               // not a compile-time constant.
//
// - By using the type CompileAssert<(bool(expr))>, we ensures that
//   expr is a compile-time constant.  (Template arguments must be
//   determined at compile-time.)
//
// - The outer parentheses in CompileAssert<(bool(expr))> are necessary
//   to work around a bug in gcc 3.4.4 and 4.0.1.  If we had written
//
//     CompileAssert<bool(expr)>
//
//   instead, these compilers will refuse to compile
//
//     COMPILE_ASSERT(5 > 0, some_message);
//
//   (They seem to think the ">" in "5 > 0" marks the end of the
//   template argument list.)
//
// - The array size is (bool(expr) ? 1 : -1), instead of simply
//
//     ((expr) ? 1 : -1).
//
//   This is to avoid running into a bug in MS VC 7.1, which
//   causes ((0.0) ? 1 : -1) to incorrectly evaluate to 1.


// bit_cast<Dest,Source> is a template function that implements the
// equivalent of "*reinterpret_cast<Dest*>(&source)".  We need this in
// very low-level functions like the protobuf library and fast math
// support.
//
//   float f = 3.14159265358979;
//   int i = bit_cast<int32>(f);
//   // i = 0x40490fdb
//
// The classical address-casting method is:
//
//   // WRONG
//   float f = 3.14159265358979;            // WRONG
//   int i = * reinterpret_cast<int*>(&f);  // WRONG
//
// The address-casting method actually produces undefined behavior
// according to ISO C++ specification section 3.10 -15 -.  Roughly, this
// section says: if an object in memory has one type, and a program
// accesses it with a different type, then the result is undefined
// behavior for most values of "different type".
//
// This is true for any cast syntax, either *(int*)&f or
// *reinterpret_cast<int*>(&f).  And it is particularly true for
// conversions betweeen integral lvalues and floating-point lvalues.
//
// The purpose of 3.10 -15- is to allow optimizing compilers to assume
// that expressions with different types refer to different memory.  gcc
// 4.0.1 has an optimizer that takes advantage of this.  So a
// non-conforming program quietly produces wildly incorrect output.
//
// The problem is not the use of reinterpret_cast.  The problem is type
// punning: holding an object in memory of one type and reading its bits
// back using a different type.
//
// The C++ standard is more subtle and complex than this, but that
// is the basic idea.
//
// Anyways ...
//
// bit_cast<> calls memcpy() which is blessed by the standard,
// especially by the example in section 3.9 .  Also, of course,
// bit_cast<> wraps up the nasty logic in one place.
//
// Fortunately memcpy() is very fast.  In optimized mode, with a
// constant size, gcc 2.95.3, gcc 4.0.1, and msvc 7.1 produce inline
// code with the minimal amount of data movement.  On a 32-bit system,
// memcpy(d,s,4) compiles to one load and one store, and memcpy(d,s,8)
// compiles to two loads and two stores.
//
// I tested this code with gcc 2.95.3, gcc 4.0.1, icc 8.1, and msvc 7.1.

// is likely to surprise you.
