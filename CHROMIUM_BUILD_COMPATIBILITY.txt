# The Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF) project is built on top of the Chromium
# project source tree. Chromium should be updated to the URL and revision listed
# below before building CEF. Chromium compatibility information for older CEF
# revisions is available by viewing this file's change history.
#
# To configure a specific Chromium URL:
#   gclient config chromium_url
#
# To update to a specific Chromium revision:
#   gclient sync --revision src@chromium_revision --jobs 8 --force
#
# This file is integrated with the CEF Automation Tool. See the
# tools/automate/automate.README.txt file for more information.
