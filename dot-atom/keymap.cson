# Your keymap
#
# Atom keymaps work similarly to style sheets. Just as style sheets use
# selectors to apply styles to elements, Atom keymaps use selectors to associate
# keystrokes with events in specific contexts. Unlike style sheets however,
# each selector can only be declared once.
#
# You can create a new keybinding in this file by typing "key" and then hitting
# tab.
#
# Here's an example taken from Atom's built-in keymap:
#
# 'atom-text-editor':
#   'enter': 'editor:newline'
#
# 'atom-workspace':
#   'ctrl-shift-p': 'core:move-up'
#   'ctrl-p': 'core:move-down'
#

# * https://atom.io/docs/latest/behind-atom-keymaps-in-depth
#
# If you're having trouble with your keybindings not working, try the
# Keybinding Resolver: `Cmd+.` on OS X and `Ctrl+.` on other platforms. See the
# Debugging Guide for more information:
