##Project
#####[Atom](https://atom.io)  The hackable text editor

####Software Process
> I'd say we follow an agile methodology, but it's pretty loose. Test driven development, rapid iteration, occasional pair programming but not much.

##### The agile methodology:
* Focus on the code rather than the design
* Iterative approach to software development
* Deliver working software quickly and evolve quickly to meet changing requirements

For the first few hundred commits, Atom had 2 contributors, [Chris Wanstrath](https://github.com/defunkt) and [Corey Johnson](https://github.com/probablycorey). We can see a lot of commits with numerous new features, changes and fixes pointing to development in **rapid iteration**.

The first commit was made on [Aug 19, 2011](https://github.com/atom/atom/commit/3a09528a62f29e86bc15140a13d1bdbd9322e0e9) by Wanstrath. The two kept working on the project and on [Dec 12, 2011](https://github.com/atom/atom/commit/0dd6df1ab6c1e4adba429bc7bbabc52d7842b3e2), there's the first **pair programming**, by Corey Johnson and [Nathan Sobo](https://github.com/nathansobo), this being the latter's first contribution to the project.

As of late September, 2015, there has been an effort to refine the **testing environment**
