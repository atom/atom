 * * NO_DOTGIT_DIR - Normally a "/.git/" will be appended to the repo

 * * MKDIR  - Make the repo_path (and workdir_path) as needed.  Init is
 *        always willing to create the ".git" directory even without this
 *        flag.  This flag tells init to create the trailing component of

 * * MKPATH - Recursively make all components of the repo and workdir
