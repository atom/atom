# Autoflow package

Format the current selection to have lines no longer than 80 characters using `cmd-alt-q` (or `cmd-opt-q`) on macOS and `ctrl-shift-q` on Windows and Linux. If nothing is selected, the current paragraph will be reflowed.

This package uses the config value of `editor.preferredLineLength` when set to determine desired line length.

A word of warning: using `shift-opt` instead of just `opt` is a macOS shortcut for force quitting all applications and logging the user out. Be careful of what you press.
