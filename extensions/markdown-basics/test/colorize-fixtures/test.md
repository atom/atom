# Header 1 #
## Header 2 ##
### Header 3 ###             (Hashes on right are optional)
## Markdown plus h2 with a custom ID ##   {#id-goes-here}
[Link back to H2](#id-goes-here)

### Alternate heading styles:
Alternate Header 1
==================
Alternate Header 2
------------------

<!-- html madness -->
<div class="custom-class" markdown="1">
  <div>
    nested div
  </div>
  <script type='text/x-koka'>
    function( x: int ) { return x*x; }
  </script>
  This is a div _with_ underscores
  and a & <b class="bold">bold</b> element.
  <style>
    body { font: "Consolas" }
  </style>
</div>

* Bullet lists are easy too
- Another one
+ Another one

    + nested list

This is a paragraph, which is text surrounded by
whitespace. Paragraphs can be on one
line (or many), and can drone on for hours.

Now some inline markup like _italics_,  **bold**,
and `code()`. Note that underscores
in_words_are ignored.

````application/json
  { value: ["or with a mime type"] }
````

> Blockquotes are like quoted text in email replies
>> And, they can be nested

1. A numbered list
    > Block quotes in list
2. Which is numbered
3. With periods and a space

And now some code:

    // Code is just text indented a bit
    which(is_easy) to_remember();

And a block

~~~
// Markdown extra adds un-indented code blocks too

if (this_is_more_code == true && !indented) {
    // tild wrapped code blocks, also not indented
}
~~~

Text with
two trailing spaces
(on the right)
can be used
for things like poems
