# How to submit your tip
To submit a tip to the list, fork the repository and add your tip to the top of the list of tips in the `README.md` file. You may want to use a [topic branch](https://github.com/dchelimsky/rspec/wiki/Topic-Branches) for each tip.

Use the format below when writing your tip. Your tip should be readable in less than two minutes. You may add links to other sites or videos that give more insight if you wish. 

Once your tip is ready, [issue a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) and your tip will be reviewed. Every day one tip will be merged from the available pull requests.

# Tip format

## #01(number) - Title

> yyyy-mm-dd(date) by @username

This is my awesome tip!

# Notes

Leave the date and the tip number empty. When we decide merge the pull request you will add them and squash your commits.

Remember: New tips must be added to the *top* of the list of [tips](https://github.com/loverajoel/jstips#tips-list) in the `README.md` file.
