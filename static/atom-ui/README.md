# :sparkles: Atom UI :sparkles:

This is Atom's UI library. Originally forked from Bootstrap `3.3.6`, then merged with some core styles and now tweaked to Atom's needy needs.

## Components

Here a list of [all components](atom-ui.less). Open the [Styleguide](https://github.com/atom/styleguide) package (`cmd-ctrl-shift-g`) to see them in action and how to use them.
