Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide,\nroyalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license to do the\nfollowing:\n\na) to reproduce the Original Work in copies;\n\nb) to prepare derivative works ('Derivative Works') based upon the Original\nWork;\n\nc) to distribute copies of the Original Work and Derivative Works to the\npublic;\n\nd) to perform the Original Work publicly; and\n\ne) to display the Original Work publicly.\n\n2) Grant of Patent License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide,\nroyalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license, under patent\nclaims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in the Original\nWork as furnished by the Licensor, to make, use, sell and offer for sale the\nOriginal Work and Derivative Works.\n\n3) Grant of Source Code License. The term 'Source Code' means the preferred\nform of the Original Work for making modifications to it and all available\ndocumentation describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor hereby\nagrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original\nWork along with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes.\nLicensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a\nmachine-readable copy of the Source Code in an information repository\nreasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for as\nlong as Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work, and by publishing\nthe address of that information repository in a notice immediately following\nthe copyright notice that applies to the Original Work.\n\n4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names\nof any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or\nservice marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this\nOriginal Work without express prior written permission of the Licensor. Nothing\nin this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights,\npatents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor except as\nexpressly stated herein. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell or\noffer to sell embodiments of any patent claims other than the licensed claims\ndefined in Section 2. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if\nsuch marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing in this License shall be\ninterpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this\nLicense any Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to\nlicense.\n\n5) This section intentionally omitted.\n\n6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative\nWorks that You create, all copyright, patent or trademark notices from the\nSource Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any\ndescriptive text identified therein as an 'Attribution Notice.' You must cause\nthe Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent\nAttribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have\nmodified the Original Work.\n\n7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that\nthe copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted herein\nby Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You under the terms\nof this License with the permission of the contributor(s) of those copyrights\nand patent rights. Except as expressly stated in the immediately proceeding\nsentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an 'AS IS' BASIS\nand WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation,\nthe warranties of NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU.\nThis DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this License. No\nlicense to Original Work is granted hereunder except under this disclaimer.\n\n8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory,\nwhether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the\nLicensor be liable to any person for any direct, indirect, special, incidental,\nor consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License\nor the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss\nof goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\nother commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not\napply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from Licensor's\nnegligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some\njurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or\nconsequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.\n\n9) Acceptance and Termination. If You distribute copies of the Original Work or\na Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to\nobtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License. Nothing\nelse but this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You)\ngrants You permission to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work\nor to exercise any of the rights granted in Section 1 herein, and any attempt\nto do so except under the terms of this License (or another written agreement\nbetween Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by U.S. copyright law, the\nequivalent laws of other countries, and by international treaty. Therefore, by\nexercising any of the rights granted to You in Section 1 herein, You indicate\nYour acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions.\n\n10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically\nand You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License\nas of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim,\nagainst Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a\npatent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging\npatent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software or\nhardware.\n\n11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this\nLicense may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the\nLicensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under\nthe laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The\napplication of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International\nSale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the\nscope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to the\nrequirements and penalties of the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. Â§ 101 et\nseq., the equivalent laws of other countries, and international treaty. This\nsection shall survive the termination of this License.\n\n12) Attorneys Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or\nseeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to\nrecover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable\nattorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including\nany appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this\nLicense.\n\n13) Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning\nthe subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\nunenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to\nmake it enforceable.\n\n14) Definition of 'You' in This License. 'You' throughout this License, whether\nin upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights\nunder, and complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal\nentities, 'You' includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is\nunder common control with you. For purposes of this definition, 'control' means\n(i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such\nentity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent\n(50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such\nentity.\n\n15) Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise\nrestricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises not\nto interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.\n\nThis license is Copyright (C) 2003-2004 Lawrence E. Rosen. All rights reserved.\nPermission is hereby granted to copy and distribute this license without\nmodification. This license may not be modified without the express written\npermission of its copyright owner."
