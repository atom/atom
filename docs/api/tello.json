      "description": "This class represents all essential editing state for a single\n{TextBuffer}, including cursor and selection positions, folds, and soft wraps.\nIf you're manipulating the state of an editor, use this class. If you're\ninterested in the visual appearance of editors, use {EditorView} instead.\n\nA single {TextBuffer} can belong to multiple editors. For example, if the\nsame file is open in two different panes, Atom creates a separate editor for\neach pane. If the buffer is manipulated the changes are reflected in both\neditors, but each maintains its own cursor position, folded lines, etc.\n\n## Accessing Editor Instances\n\nThe easiest way to get hold of `Editor` objects is by registering a callback\nwith `::eachEditor` on the `atom.workspace` global. Your callback will then\nbe called with all current editor instances and also when any editor is\ncreated in the future.\n\n```coffeescript\n  atom.workspace.eachEditor (editor) ->\n    editor.insertText('Hello World')\n```\n\n## Buffer vs. Screen Coordinates\n\nBecause editors support folds and soft-wrapping, the lines on screen don't\nalways match the lines in the buffer. For example, a long line that soft wraps\ntwice renders as three lines on screen, but only represents one line in the\nbuffer. Similarly, if rows 5-10 are folded, then row 6 on screen corresponds\nto row 11 in the buffer.\n\nYour choice of coordinates systems will depend on what you're trying to\nachieve. For example, if you're writing a command that jumps the cursor up or\ndown by 10 lines, you'll want to use screen coordinates because the user\nprobably wants to skip lines *on screen*. However, if you're writing a package\nthat jumps between method definitions, you'll want to work in buffer\ncoordinates.\n\n**When in doubt, just default to buffer coordinates**, then experiment with\nsoft wraps and folds to ensure your code interacts with them correctly.\n\n## Common Tasks\n\nThis is a subset of methods on this class.

      "description": "Allows commands to be associated with keystrokes in a\ncontext-sensitive way. In Atom, you can access a global instance of this\nobject via `atom.keymap`.\n\nKey bindings are plain JavaScript objects containing **CSS selectors** as\ntheir top level keys, then **keystroke patterns** mapped to commands.\n\n```cson\n'.workspace':\n  'ctrl-l': 'package:do-something'\n  'ctrl-z': 'package:do-something-else'\n'.mini.editor':\n  'enter': 'core:confirm'\n```\n\nWhen a keystroke sequence matches a binding in a given context, a custom DOM\nevent with a type based on the command is dispatched on the target of the\nkeyboard event.\n\nTo match a keystroke sequence, the keymap starts at the target element for the\nkeyboard event. It looks for key bindings associated with selectors that match\nthe target element. If multiple match, the most specific is selected. If there\nis a tie in specificity, the most recently added binding wins. If no bindings\nare found for the events target, the search is repeated again for the target's\nparent node and so on recursively until a binding is found or we traverse off\nthe top of the document.\n\nWhen a binding is found, its command event is always dispatched on the\noriginal target of the keyboard event, even if the matching element is higher\nup in the DOM. In addition, `.preventDefault()` is called on the keyboard\nevent to prevent the browser from taking action. `.preventDefault` is only\ncalled if a matching binding is found.\n\nCommand event objects have a non-standard method called `.abortKeyBinding()`.\nIf your command handler is invoked but you programmatically determine that no\naction can be taken and you want to allow other bindings to be matched, call\n`.abortKeyBinding()` on the event object. An example of where this is useful\nis binding snippet expansion to `tab`. If `snippets:expand` is invoked when\nthe cursor does not follow a valid snippet prefix, we abort the binding and\nallow `tab` to be handled by the default handler, which inserts whitespace.\n\nMulti-keystroke bindings are possible. If a sequence of one or more keystrokes\n*partially* matches a multi-keystroke binding, the keymap enters a pending\nstate. The pending state is terminated on the next keystroke, or after\n{::partialMatchTimeout} milliseconds has elapsed. When the pending state is\nterminated via a timeout or a keystroke that leads to no matches, the longest\nambiguous bindings that caused the pending state are temporarily disabled and\nthe previous keystrokes are replayed. If there is ambiguity again during the\nreplay, the next longest bindings are disabled and the keystrokes are replayed\nagain.",

This is used to represent cursors, folds, snippet\ntargets, misspelled words, and anything else that needs to track a logical\nlocation in the buffer over time.\n\nHead and Tail:\nMarkers always have a *head* and sometimes have a *tail*. If you think of a\nmarker as an editor selection, the tail is the part that's stationary and the\nhead is the part that moves when the mouse is moved. A marker without a tail\nalways reports an empty range at the head position. A marker with a head position\ngreater than the tail is in a \"normal\" orientation. If the head precedes the\ntail the marker is in a \"reversed\" orientation.\n\nValidity:\nMarkers are considered *valid* when they are first created. Depending on the\ninvalidation strategy you choose, certain changes to the buffer can cause a\nmarker to become invalid, for example if the text surrounding the marker is\ndeleted. See {TextBuffer::markRange} for invalidation strategies.\n\nChange events:\nWhen markers change in position for any reason, the emit a 'changed' event with\nthe following properties:\n\n* oldHeadPosition:\n    A {Point} representing the former head position\n* newHeadPosition:\n    A {Point} representing the new head position\n* oldTailPosition:\n    A {Point} representing the former tail position\n* newTailPosition:\n    A {Point} representing the new tail position\n* wasValid:\n    A {Boolean} indicating whether the marker was valid before the change\n* isValid:\n    A {Boolean} indicating whether the marker is now valid\n* hadTail:\n    A {Boolean} indicating whether the marker had a tail before the change\n* hasTail:\n    A {Boolean} indicating whether the marker now has a tail\n* oldProperties:\n    An {Object} containing the marker's custom properties before the change.\n* newProperties:\n    An {Object} containing the marker's custom properties after the change.\n* textChanged:\n    A {Boolean} indicating whether this change was caused by a textual change\n    to the buffer or whether the marker was manipulated directly via its public\n    API.
