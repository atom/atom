## Summary

One paragraph explanation of the feature.

## Motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?

## Explanation

Explain the proposal as if it was already implemented and you were describing it to an Atom user. That generally means:

- Introducing new named concepts.
- Explaining the feature largely in terms of examples.
- Explaining any changes to existing workflows.

## Drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this?

## Rationale and alternatives

- What other approaches have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them?
- What is the impact of not doing this?

## Unresolved questions

- What unresolved questions do you expect to resolve through the RFC process before this gets merged?
- What unresolved questions do you expect to resolve through the implementation of this feature before it is released in a new version of Atom?
- What related issues do you consider out of scope for this RFC that could be addressed in the future independently of the solution that comes out of this RFC?
