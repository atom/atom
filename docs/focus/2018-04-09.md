## Highlights from the past week

- Atom IDE
- GitHub Package
  - Began transcribing our vision meeting notes in [atom/github#1372](https://github.com/atom/github/pull/1372). @smashwilson
  - More progress on [atom/github#1376 "Create pull request"](https://github.com/atom/github/pull/1376). The happy paths work well for publishing and pushing a branch, but it isn't ready to merge until I adjust our messaging in a few edge cases. @smashwilson
  - Started implementing [atom/github/#1374 "Add dialog for new co-author"](https://github.com/atom/github/pull/1374).  This includes UI polish and some bugfixes for existing co author flows.  @kuychaco / @annthurium
  - Merged [atom/github#1364 "Undo last commit and amend context menu option"](https://github.com/atom/github/pull/1364) @kuychaco / @annthurium
- Teletype
  - Enhanced file metadata syncing to update guest workspaces when host renames a shared file ([atom/teletype#147](https://github.com/atom/teletype/issues/147#issuecomment-378401644)). Thanks, [@CaptainJohnyAppleSeed](https://github.com/CaptainJohnyAppleSeed) and [@odoyle71](https://github.com/odoyle71)!
  - Improved handling (hopefully ðŸ¤ž) of potential race condition when joining a portal with poor network connectivity ([atom/teletype-client#58](https://github.com/atom/teletype-client/pull/58))
  - Published [Teletype 0.12.0](https://github.com/atom/teletype/releases/tag/v0.12.0) with the above improvements
- Xray
  - Started on support for shared remote workspaces by developing an RPC system for use between Xray peers.
  - See [this week's in-depth update](https://github.com/atom/xray/blob/master/docs/updates/2018_04_09.md) for details.
- Reactor Duty
  - Fixed an issue that sometimes prevented the fuzzy-finder from showing local files when Teletype is installed  ([atom/fuzzy-finder#343](https://github.com/atom/fuzzy-finder/issues/343))
  - Shipped [Atom 1.25.1](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/tag/v1.25.1) and [1.26.0-beta1](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/tag/v1.26.0-beta1)
