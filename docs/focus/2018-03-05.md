## Focus for week ahead

- Atom IDE
  - Console logging completion
  - Investigate language server process hanging on deactivation in ide-typescript
  - Investigate using the new native LSP support in omnisharp-roslyn in ide-csharp
- @atom/watcher
  - Diagnose crashes and lockups on Atom launch (@smashwilson)
- GitHub Package
  - Finish "Remember me" within the credential dialog (@smashwilson) [#1327](https://github.com/atom/github/pull/1327)
  - Write up `docs/vision` from meeting notes (@smashwilson)
  - Kick-start our GPG pinentry handling (@smashwilson) [#846](https://github.com/atom/github/pull/846)
  - Build UI for adding co-authors, much like Desktop's UI/UX - desktop.github.com/features/co-authors/
- Teletype
  - Open pull request for the avatar UX enhancements described in ([atom/teletype#268](https://github.com/atom/teletype/issues/268))
- Tree-sitter
  - Carrying over goals from previous weeks:
    - Optimize syntax tree updates in the presence of syntax errors. This will improve performance across the board but also make Tree-sitter usable in edge cases where the wrong language is being used to parse a document.
    - Start work on allowing parsing to take place on a background thread
- Xray
  - Finish selection rendering
  - Wire up enough of the key bindings / commands system to move cursors/selections
  - Start on editing
  - For more details, see [the detailed update](https://github.com/atom/xray/blob/master/docs/updates/2018_03_05.md)
