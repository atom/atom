# Creating a Theme

Atom's interface is rendered using HTML and it's styled via [LESS] (a superset
of CSS). Don't worry if you haven't heard of LESS before, it's just like CSS but
with a few handy extensions.

Since CSS is the basis of the theming system, we can load multiple themes within
Atom and they behaves just as they would on a website. Themes loaded first are overridden by
themes which are loaded later (the order is controlled from within the Settings
pane).

This flexibility is helpful for users which prefer a light interface with a dark
syntax theme. Atom currently has only interface and syntax themes but it is
possible to create a theme to style something specific &mdash; say a changing
the colors in the tree view or creating a language specific syntax theme.

## Getting Started

To create your own theme you'll need a few things:

* A working install of [Atom], so you can work on your new theme.
* A working install of [git] to track changes.
* And a [GitHub] account, so you can distribute your themes.

Themes are pretty straight forward but it's still helpful to be familiar with
a few things before starting:

* LESS is a superset of CSS but it has some really handy features like
  variables. If you aren't familiar with its syntax take a few minutes
  to [familiarize yourself][less-tutorial].
* Atom uses Chrome at its core, so you can use Chrome devtools to
  inspect the current state of the interface. Checkout Google's
  [extensive tutorial][devtools-tutorial] for a short introduction.

## Creating a Minimal Syntax Theme

1. Open the Command Palette (`cmd-p`)
1. Search for `Package Generator: Generate Syntax Theme` and select it.
1. Choose a name for your theme. A folder will be created with this name.
1. Press enter to create your theme. After creation, your theme will be
   installed and enabled.
1. An Atom window will open with your newly created theme.
  1. Open `package.json` and update the relevant parts.
  1. Open `stylesheets/colors.less` to change the various colors variables which
     have been already been defined.
  1. Open `stylesheets/base.less` and modify the various syntax CSS selectors
     that have been already been defined.
  1. When you're ready, update the `README.md` and include an example screenshot
     of your new theme in action.
1. Reload atom (`cmd-r`) to see changes you made reflected in your Atom window.
1. Look in the theme settings, your new theme should be show in the enabled themes section
    ![themesettings-img]
1. Open a terminal to your new theme directory; it should be in `~/.atom/packages/<my-name>`.  
  1. To publish, initialize a git repository, push to GitHub, and run
     `apm publish`.

Want to make edits and have them immediately show up without reloading? Open a
development window (__View > Developer > Open in Dev Mode__ menu) to the
directory of your choice &mdash; even the new theme itself. Then just edit away!
Changes will be instantly reflected in the editor without having to reload.

## Interface Themes

There are only two differences between interface and syntax themes - what
they target and what they provide. Interface themes only target elements which
are outside of the editor and **must** provide a `ui-variables.less` file which
contains all of the variables provided by the [core themes][ui-variables].

To create a UI theme, do the following:

1. Fork one of the following repos
  1. [atom-dark-ui]
  1. [atom-light-ui]
1. Open a terminal in the forked theme's directory
1. Open your new theme in a Dev Mode Atom window (run `atom -d .` in the terminal or use the __View > Developer > Open in Dev Mode__ menu)
1. Change the name of the theme in the theme's `package.json` file
1. Run `apm link` to tell Atom about your new theme
1. Reload Atom (`cmd-r`)
1. Enable the theme via the themes panel in settings
1. Make changes! Since you opened the theme in a Dev Mode window, changes will
   be instantly reflected in the editor without having to reload.

## Development workflow

There are a few of tools to help make theme development fast.

### Live Reload

Reloading via `cmd-r` after you make changes to your theme less than ideal. Atom
supports [live updating][livereload] of styles on Dev Mode Atom windows.

1. Open your theme directory in a dev window by either using the
__View > Developer > Open in Dev Mode__ menu or the `cmd-shift-o` shortcut
1. Make a change to your theme file and save &mdash; your change should be
immediately applied!

If you'd like to reload all styles at any time, you can use the shortcut
`cmd-ctrl-shift-r`.

### Developer Tools

Atom is based on the Chrome browser, and supports Chrome's Developer Tools. You
can open them by selecting the __View > Toggle Developer Tools__ menu or by using the
`cmd-option-i` shortcut.

The dev tools allow you to inspect elements and take a look at their CSS
properties.

### Atom Styleguide

If you are creating an interface theme, you'll want a way to see how your theme
changes affect all the components in the system. The [styleguide] is a page with
every component Atom supports rendered.

To open the styleguide, open the command palette (`cmd-p`) and search for
_styleguide_ or use the shortcut `cmd-ctrl-shift-g`.
