# Linux

Ubuntu LTS 12.04 64-bit is the recommended platform.

## Requirements

  * OS with 64-bit or 32-bit architecture
  * [node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/) v0.10.x
  * [npm](http://www.npmjs.org/) v1.4.x  
  * libgnome-keyring-dev
    * on Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install libgnome-keyring-dev`
    * on Fedora: `sudo yum --assumeyes install libgnome-keyring-devel`
    * on other distributions refer to the manual on how to install packages
  * `npm config set python /usr/bin/python2 -g` to ensure that gyp uses Python 2
    * This command may require `sudo` depending on how you have
      [configured npm](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager#ubuntu-mint-elementary-os).


## Instructions

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/atom/atom
  cd atom
  script/build # Creates application at $TMPDIR/atom-build/Atom
  sudo script/grunt install # Installs command to /usr/local/bin/atom
  script/grunt mkdeb # Generates a .deb package at $TMPDIR/atom-build
  ```

## Troubleshooting


### Exception: "TypeError: Unable to watch path"

If you get following error with a big traceback right after Atom starts:

  ```
  TypeError: Unable to watch path
  ```

you have to increase number of watched files by inotify.  For testing if
this is the reason for this error you can issue

  ```sh
  sudo sysctl fs.inotify.max_user_watches=32768
  ```

and restart Atom.  If Atom now works fine, you can make this setting permanent:

  ```sh
  echo 32768 > /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches
  ```

### Ubuntu 14.04, gyp, Python

  ```
  gyp_main.py: error: no such option: --no-parallel
  gyp ERR! configure error 
  gyp ERR! stack Error: `gyp` failed with exit code: 2
  ```

`npm config set python /usr/bin/python2 -g` is not enough on 14.04 because gyp requires Python 2.6 (not 2.7)

One solution is to use Atom with a Python version manager 2.6+ instead of `npm config set python...`
