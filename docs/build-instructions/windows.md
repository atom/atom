# Windows

## Requirements

### On Windows 7
  * [Visual C++ 2010 Express](http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs#DownloadFamilies_4)
  * [Visual Studio 2010 Service Pack 1](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=23691)
  * [node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/) (0.10.x or 0.12.x) or [io.js](https://iojs.org) (1.x)
    * For 64-bit builds of node and native modules you **must** have the
    [Windows 7 64-bit SDK](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8279).
    You may also need the [compiler update for the Windows SDK 7.1](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=4422)
  * [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) v2.7.
    * The python.exe must be available at `%SystemDrive%\Python27\python.exe`.
      If it is installed elsewhere, you can create a symbolic link to the
      directory containing the python.exe using:
      `mklink /d %SystemDrive%\Python27 D:\elsewhere\Python27`
  * [GitHub for Windows](http://windows.github.com/)

### On Windows 8
  * [Visual Studio Express 2013 for Windows Desktop](http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs#DownloadFamilies_2)
  * [node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/) (0.10.x or 0.12.x) or [io.js](https://iojs.org) (1.x)
  * [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) v2.7.x (required by [node-gyp](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp))
  * [GitHub for Windows](http://windows.github.com/)

## Instructions

```bash
# Use the `Git Shell` program which was installed by GitHub for Windows.
# Also make sure that you are logged into GitHub for Windows.
cd C:\
git clone https://github.com/atom/atom/
cd atom
script/build # Creates application in the `Program Files` directory
```

### `script/build` Options
  * `--install-dir` - Creates the final built application in this directory.
  * `--build-dir` - Build the application in this directory.
  * `--verbose` - Verbose mode. A lot more information output.

## Why do I have to use GitHub for Windows?

You don't. You can use your existing Git! GitHub for Windows's Git Shell is just
easier to set up.

If you _prefer_ using your existing Git installation, make sure git's cmd directory is in your PATH env variable (e.g. `C:\Program Files (x86)\Git\cmd`) before you open your powershell or command window.
Note that you may have to open your command window as administrator. For powershell that doesn't seem to always be the case, though.

If none of this works, do install Github for Windows and use its Git shell. Makes life easier.


## Troubleshooting

### Common Errors
* `node is not recognized`

  * If you just installed node, you'll need to restart your computer before node is
  available on your Path.


* `script/build` outputs only the Node and Python versions before returning

  * Try moving the repository to `C:\atom`. Most likely, the path is too long.
    See [issue #2200](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/2200).

* `error MSB4025: The project file could not be loaded. Invalid character in the given encoding.`

  * These can occur because your home directory (`%USERPROFILE%`) has non-ASCII
    characters in it. This is a bug in [gyp](https://code.google.com/p/gyp/)
    which is used to build native node modules and there is no known workaround.
    * https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp/issues/297
    * https://code.google.com/p/gyp/issues/detail?id=393

* `script/build` stops at installing runas with 'Failed at the runas@0.5.4 install script.'

  See the next item.

* `error MSB8020: The build tools for Visual Studio 2010 (Platform Toolset = 'v100') cannot be found.`

  * If you're building atom with Visual Studio 2013 try executing the following
    command in your Git shell and then re-run `script/build`:

    ```
    $env:GYP_MSVS_VERSION=2013
    ```
  * If you are using Visual Studio 2013 and the build fails with some other error message this environment variable might still be required.

* Other `node-gyp` errors on first build attempt, even though the right node and python versions are installed.
  * Do try the build command one more time, as experience shows it often works on second try in many of these cases.


### Windows build error reports in atom/atom
* If all fails, use [this search](https://github.com/atom/atom/search?q=label%3Abuild-error+label%3Awindows&type=Issues) to get a list of reports about build errors on Windows, and see if yours has already been reported.

* If it hasn't, please open a new issue with your Windows version 32/64bit and a print/screenshot of your build output, incl. the node and python versions.
