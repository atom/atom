## Atom Terminal

Atom includes a Terminal emulator package for running a shell like `bash` directly
from within Atom.

### Usage

To open a Terminal pane either press `alt-down` or run `Terminal: Create Split
Down` from the Command Panel.

This will open the Terminal in a split pane in the lower half of the current
pane.

### Compatibility

Atom Terminal strives to be fully XTerm and VT100 compatible where it makes
sense. If a common CLI application does not work correctly it is considered a
bug.

### Current Limitations

* No Mouse support
