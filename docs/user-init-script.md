# User Init Script

When Atom finishes loading, it will evaluate `user.coffee` in your `~/.atom`
directory, giving you a chance to run arbitrary personal CoffeeScript code to
make customizations. You have full access to Atom's API from code in this file.
Please refer to the Atom Internals Guide for more information. If your
customizations become extensive, consider creating a package.
