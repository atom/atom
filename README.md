[![Dependency Status](https://david-dm.org/atom/atom.svg)](https://david-dm.org/atom/atom)

Atom is a hackable text editor for the 21st century, built on [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron), and based on everything we love about our favorite editors. We designed it to be deeply customizable, but still approachable using the default configuration.

## Documentation

If you want to read about using Atom or developing packages in Atom, the [Atom Flight Manual](https://flight-manual.atom.io) is free and available online. You can find the source to the manual in [atom/flight-manual.atom.io](https://github.com/atom/flight-manual.atom.io).

The [API reference](https://atom.io/docs/api) for developing packages is also documented on Atom.io.

## Installing

### Prerequisites
- [Git](https://git-scm.com)

### macOS

Download the latest [Atom release](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/latest).

Atom will automatically update when a new release is available.

### Windows

Download the latest [Atom installer](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/latest). `AtomSetup.exe` is 32-bit. For 64-bit systems, download `AtomSetup-x64.exe`.

Atom will automatically update when a new release is available.

You can also download `atom-windows.zip` (32-bit) or `atom-x64-windows.zip` (64-bit) from the [releases page](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/latest).
The `.zip` version will not automatically update.

Using [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org)? Run `cinst Atom` to install the latest version of Atom.

### Linux

Atom is only available for 64-bit Linux systems.

Configure your distribution's package manager to install and update Atom by following the [Linux installation instructions](https://flight-manual.atom.io/getting-started/sections/installing-atom/#platform-linux) in the Flight Manual.  You will also find instructions on how to install Atom's official Linux packages without using a package repository, though you will not get automatic updates after installing Atom this way.

#### Archive extraction

An archive is available for people who don't want to install `atom` as root.

This version enables you to install multiple Atom versions in parallel. It has been built on Ubuntu 64-bit,
but should be compatible with other Linux distributions.

1. Install dependencies (on Ubuntu): `sudo apt install git libasound2, libcurl4, libgbm1, libgcrypt20, libgtk-3-0, libnotify4, libnss3, libglib2.0-bin, xdg-utils, libx11-xcb1, libxcb-dri3-0, libxss1, libxtst6, libxkbfile1`
2. Download `atom-amd64.tar.gz` from the [Atom releases page](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/latest).
3. Run `tar xf atom-amd64.tar.gz` in the directory where you want to extract the Atom folder.
4. Launch Atom using the installed `atom` command from the newly extracted directory.

The Linux version does not currently automatically update so you will need to
repeat these steps to upgrade to future releases.
