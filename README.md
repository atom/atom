Atom is a hackable text editor for the 21st century, built on [atom-shell](http://github.com/atom/atom-shell), and based on everything we love about our favorite editors. We designed it to be deeply customizable, but still approachable using the default configuration.

## Installing

### Mac OS X

Download the latest [Atom release](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/latest).

Atom will automatically update when a new release is available.

### Windows

Download the latest [AtomSetup.exe installer](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/latest).

Atom will automatically update when a new release is available.

You can also download an `atom-windows.zip` file from the [releases page](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/latest).
The `.zip` version will not automatically update.

#### Uninstalling Chocolatey Version

The recommended installation of Atom on Windows used to be using [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/Atom/).
This is no longer recommended now that the Atom Windows installer & auto-updater
exists.

To switch from Chocolatey to the new installer:
  * Upgrade to Atom 0.155 or above by running `cup Atom`
  * Run `cuninst Atom` to uninstall the Chocolatey version of Atom
    * This will not delete any of your installed packages or Atom config files.
  * Download the latest [AtomSetup.exe installer](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/latest).
  * Double-click the downloaded file to install Atom

### Debian Linux (Ubuntu)

Currently only a 64-bit version is available.

1. Download `atom-amd64.deb` from the [Atom releases page](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/latest).
2. Run `sudo dpkg --install atom-amd64.deb` on the downloaded package.
3. Launch Atom using the installed `atom` command.

The Linux version does not currently automatically update so you will need to
repeat these steps to upgrade to future releases.
