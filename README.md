Atom is a hackable text editor for the 21st century, built on [atom-shell](http://github.com/atom/atom-shell), and based on everything we love about our favorite editors. We designed it to be deeply customizable, but still approachable using the default configuration.

## Installing

### Mac OS X

Download the latest [Atom release](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/latest).

Atom will automatically update when a new release is available.

### Windows

Install the [Atom chocolatey package](https://chocolatey.org/packages/Atom).

1. Install [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org).
2. Close and reopen your command prompt or PowerShell window.
3. Run `cinst Atom`
4. In the future run `cup Atom` to upgrade to the latest release.

You can also download a `.zip` file from the [releases page](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/latest).
The Windows version does not currently automatically update so you will need to
manually upgrade to future releases by re-downloading the `.zip` file.

### Debian Linux (Ubuntu)

Currently only a 64-bit version is available.

1. Download `atom-amd64.deb` from the [Atom releases page](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/latest).
2. Run `sudo dpkg --install atom-amd64.deb` on the downloaded package.
3. Launch Atom using the installed `atom` command.

The Linux version does not currently automatically update so you will need to
repeat these steps to upgrade to future releases.
