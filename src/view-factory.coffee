  # Essential: Add a provider that will be used by {::createView} to construct
  # an element based on the constructor of the given model object.
  #
  # ## Examples
  #
  # Text editors are divided into a model and a view layer, so when you interact
  # with methods like `atom.workspace.getActiveTextEditor()` you're only going
  # to get the model object. We display text editors on screen by teaching the
  # workspace what view constructor it should use to represent them:
  #
  # ```coffee
  # atom.views.addViewProvider
  #   modelConstructor: TextEditor
  #   viewConstructor: TextEditorElement
  # ```
  #
  # * `providerSpec` {Object} containing the following keys:
  #   * `modelConstructor` Constructor {Function} for your model.
  #   * `viewConstructor` (Optional) Constructor {Function} for your view. It
  #     should be a subclass of `HTMLElement` (that is, your view should be a
  #     DOM node) and   have a `::setModel()` method which will be called
  #     immediately after construction. If you don't supply this property, you
  #     must supply the `createView` property with a function that never returns
  #     `undefined`.
  #   * `createView` (Optional) Factory {Function} that must return a subclass
  #     of `HTMLElement` or `undefined`. If this property is not present or the
  #     function returns `undefined`, the view provider will fall back to the
  #     `viewConstructor` property. If you don't provide this property, you must
  #     provider a `viewConstructor` property.
  #
  # Returns a {Disposable} on which `.dispose()` can be called to remove the
  # added provider.

  #   `initialize` will be called on the element after creation with the
