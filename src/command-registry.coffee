# Public: Associates listener functions with commands in a
# context-sensitive way using CSS selectors. You can access a global instance of
# this class via `atom.commands`, and commands registered there will be
# presented in the command palette.
#
# The global command registry facilitates a style of event handling known as
# *event delegation* that was popularized by jQuery. Atom commands are expressed
# as custom DOM events that can be invoked on the currently focused element via
# a key binding or manually via the command palette. Rather than binding
# listeners for command events directly to DOM nodes, you instead register
# command event listeners globally on `atom.commands` and constrain them to
# specific kinds of elements with CSS selectors.
#
# As the event bubbles upward through the DOM, all registered event listeners
# with matching selectors are invoked in order of specificity. In the event of a
# specificity tie, the most recently registered listener is invoked first. This
# mirrors the "cascade" semantics of CSS. Event listeners are invoked in the
# context of the current DOM node, meaning `this` always points at
# `event.currentTarget`. As is normally the case with DOM events,
# `stopPropagation` and `stopImmediatePropagation` can be used to terminate the
# bubbling process and prevent invocation of additional listeners.
#
# ## Example
#
# Here is a command that inserts the current date in an editor:
#
# ```coffee
# atom.commands.add 'atom-text-editor',
#   'user:insert-date': (event) ->
#     editor = @getModel()
#     editor.insertText(new Date().toLocaleString())
# ```

  # Public: Add one or more command listeners associated with a selector.
  #
  # ## Arguments: Registering One Command
  #
  # * `target` A {String} containing a CSS selector or a DOM element. If you
  #   pass a selector, the command will be globally associated with all matching
  #   elements. The `,` combinator is not currently supported. If you pass a
  #   DOM element, the command will be associated with just that element.
  # * `commandName` A {String} containing the name of a command you want to
  #   handle such as `user:insert-date`.
  # * `callback` A {Function} to call when the given command is invoked on an
  #   element matching the selector. It will be called with `this` referencing
  #   the matching DOM node.
  #   * `event` A standard DOM event instance. Call `stopPropagation` or
  #     `stopImmediatePropagation` to terminate bubbling early.
  #
  # ## Arguments: Registering Multiple Commands
  #
  # * `target` A {String} containing a CSS selector or a DOM element. If you
  #   pass a selector, the commands will be globally associated with all
  #   matching elements. The `,` combinator is not currently supported.
  #   If you pass a DOM element, the command will be associated with just that
  #   element.
  # * `commands` An {Object} mapping command names like `user:insert-date` to
  #   listener {Function}s.
  #
  # Returns a {Disposable} on which `.dispose()` can be called to remove the
  # added command handler(s).

  #  * `name` The name of the command. For example, `user:insert-date`.
