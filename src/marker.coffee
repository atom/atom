# Essential: Represents a buffer annotation that remains logically stationary
# even as the buffer changes. This is used to represent cursors, folds, snippet
# targets, misspelled words, and anything else that needs to track a logical
# location in the buffer over time.
#
# ### Marker Creation
#
# Use {TextEditor::markBufferRange} rather than creating Markers directly.
#
# ### Head and Tail
#
# Markers always have a *head* and sometimes have a *tail*. If you think of a
# marker as an editor selection, the tail is the part that's stationary and the
# head is the part that moves when the mouse is moved. A marker without a tail
# always reports an empty range at the head position. A marker with a head position
# greater than the tail is in a "normal" orientation. If the head precedes the
# tail the marker is in a "reversed" orientation.
#
# ### Validity
#
# Markers are considered *valid* when they are first created. Depending on the
# invalidation strategy you choose, certain changes to the buffer can cause a
# marker to become invalid, for example if the text surrounding the marker is
# deleted. The strategies, in order of descending fragility:
#
# * __never__: The marker is never marked as invalid. This is a good choice for
#   markers representing selections in an editor.
# * __surround__: The marker is invalidated by changes that completely surround it.
# * __overlap__: The marker is invalidated by changes that surround the
#   start or end of the marker. This is the default.
# * __inside__: The marker is invalidated by changes that extend into the
#   inside of the marker. Changes that end at the marker's start or
#   start at the marker's end do not invalidate the marker.
# * __touch__: The marker is invalidated by a change that touches the marked
#   region in any way, including changes that end at the marker's
#   start or start at the marker's end. This is the most fragile strategy.
#
# See {TextEditor::markBufferRange} for usage.
