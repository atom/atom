  <remarks>
    WARNING:  DO NOT MODIFY this file unless you are knowledgeable about MSBuild and have
              created a backup copy.  Incorrect changes to this file will make it
              impossible to load or build your projects from the command-line or the IDE.

    This file defines the steps in the standard build process for WiX projects (.wixproj).

    Conventions:
      * Targets and properties that start with an underscore (_) are considered private and should not
        be used outside of this file.

    Coding Conventions:
      * Two-space indentation of nested elements

      * Self-closing elements should have a space before the /> ("<MyProperty />")

      * Conditions should have a space before and after the "" and between any operators. For example:
        <MyProperty Condition=" '$(MyProperty)' == '' ">Value</MyProperty>

      * Targets should have each attribute on a single line and indented by two spaces. Also, there
        should be a blank line between the Target and the beginning of the contents (a blank line is
        optional before the closing </Target> tag).
        For example:
        <Target
          Name="MyTarget"
          DependsOnTargets="$(MyTargetDependsOn)">

          <Message Importance="low" Text="MyTarget is doing something." />
        </Target>
